## 2 Chronicles 7:19-22  
**LSV:**  
"And if you turn back, and forsake My statutes and My commands that I have placed before you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them—then I have plucked them from off My ground that I have given to them, and this house that I have sanctified for My Name I cast from My presence, and make it for a byword and for a tale among all the peoples. And this house that has been high, everyone passing by it is astonished, and has said, ‘Why has YHWH done thus to this land and to this house?’ And they have said, ‘Because they have forsaken YHWH, God of their fathers, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and bowed themselves to them, and served them—that He brought all this calamity on them.’"

**NRSV:**  
"But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, then I will pluck you up from the land that I have given you; and this house, which I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. And regarding this house, now exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this house?’ Then they will say, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD the God of their ancestors who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them; therefore he has brought all this calamity upon them.’"
