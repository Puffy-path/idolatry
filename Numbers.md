## Numbers 21:5-7  
**LSV:**  
"And the people speak against God and against Moses, 'Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in a wilderness? For there is no bread and there is no water, and our soul has been weary of this light bread.' And YHWH sends fiery serpents among the people, and they bite the people, and many people of Israel die; and the people come to Moses and say, 'We have sinned, for we have spoken against YHWH and against you; pray to YHWH, and He turns aside the serpent from us'; and Moses prays for the people."

**NRSV:**  
"The people spoke against God and against Moses, 'Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.' Then the LORD sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. The people came to Moses and said, 'We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you; pray to the LORD to take away the serpents from us.' So Moses prayed for the people."

**NRSV:**  
"While Israel was staying at Shittim, the people began to have sexual relations with the women of Moab. These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.

## Notes  
- **Baal-Peor (Numbers 25):** Represents a major act of idolatry, where Israel worshiped the Moabite god Baal through illicit rituals and sacrifices.
- **High places and carved images:** Refer to locations and objects used in pagan worship, condemned by God.
- **Bowing to angels (Numbers 22:31):** Balaam’s bowing to the angel underscores the need for proper understanding of worship boundaries.
- **Fiery serpents (Numbers 21):** Sent as punishment for rebellion and complaining, illustrating consequences of disobedience.
