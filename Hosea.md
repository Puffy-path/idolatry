## Hosea 2:7-8  
**LSV:**  
"And she has pursued her lovers, || And she does not overtake them, || And she has sought them, and does not find, || And she has said, 'I go, and return to my first husband, || For — better to me then than now.' And she has not known that I have given her the grain, || And the new wine, and the oil, || And I multiplied silver to her, || And the gold they prepared for Ba‘al."

**NRSV:**  
"She shall pursue her lovers, but not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, 'I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better with me then than now.' She did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the wine, and the oil, and who lavished upon her silver and gold that they used for Baal."

## Hosea 4:12-13  
**LSV:**  
"My people seek counsel from their wood, || And their staff declares to them, || For a spirit of whoredoms has caused to err, || And they go whoring from under their God. On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, || And on the hills burn incense, || Under oak, and poplar, and terebinth, || For its shade [is] good; Therefore your daughters commit whoredom, || And your brides commit adultery."

**NRSV:**  
"My people consult a piece of wood, and their divining rod gives them oracles. For a spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have played the whore, forsaking their God. They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and make offerings upon the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good. Therefore your daughters prostitute themselves, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery."

## Hosea 8:4-6  
**LSV:**  
"They have caused kings to reign, and not by Me, || They have caused princes to rule, and I have not known [it]. || They have made their silver and their gold into idols for themselves, || So that they are cut off. Your calf has cast you off, O Samaria, || My anger has burned against them, || Until when are they not able for purity? For even it [is] of Israel; a craftsman made it, || And it is not God, || For the calf of Samaria is a splinter."

**NRSV:**  
"They made kings, but not through me; they set up princes, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for their own destruction. Your calf is rejected, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence? For it is from Israel, an artisan made it; it is not God. The calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces."

## Hosea 9:10  
**LSV:**  
"I found Israel as grapes in a wilderness, || I saw your fathers as first-fruit in a fig-tree at its first season, || They—they have gone in to Ba‘al-Peor, || And are separated to a shameful thing, || And are become abominable like their love."

**NRSV:**  
"Like grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel. Like the first fruit on the fig tree in its first season, I saw your ancestors. But they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to a thing of shame, and became detestable like the thing they loved."

## Hosea 11:2  
**LSV:**  
"They have called to them so—They have gone from before them, || They sacrifice to the Ba‘alim, || And make incense to carved images."

**NRSV:**  
"The more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols."

## Hosea 13:1-2  
**LSV:**  
"When Ephraim spoke trembling, || He was lifted up in Israel, || When he becomes guilty through Ba‘al, he dies. And now they sin more and more, || And make a molten image of their silver, || Idols according to their own understanding, || Work of artisans—all of it; Of them they say, || Let men kissing calves sacrifice."

**NRSV:**  
"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel; but he incurred guilt through Baal and died. And now they keep on sinning and make a cast image for themselves, idols of silver made according to their understanding, all of them the work of artisans. Sacrifice to these, they say. People are kissing calves!"

## Hosea 14:3  
**LSV:**  
"Asshur does not save us, we do not ride on a horse, || Nor do we say anymore to the work of our hands, || Our God—you [are]! For the fatherless finds mercy in You."

**NRSV:**  
"Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; we will say no more, ‘Our God,’ to the work of our hands. In you the orphan finds mercy."

- **Calf worship condemned (Hosea 8:6; 13:1-2):** Refers to the persistent sin of worshiping the golden calf.
- **False security in foreign powers (Hosea 14:3):** Dependence on human alliances and idols is rejected.
