## Deuteronomy 4:15-19  
**LSV:**  
"And you have been very watchful of your souls—for you have not seen any likeness in the day of YHWH’s speaking to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire—lest you do corruptly and have made a carved image for yourselves, a likeness of any figure, a form of male or female, a form of any beast which [is] in the earth, a form of any winged bird which flies in the heavens, a form of any creeping thing on the ground, a form of any fish which [is] in the waters under the earth; and lest you lift up your eyes to the heavens, and have seen the sun, and the moon, and the stars—all the host of the heavens—and have been drawn away, and have bowed yourself to them and served them, which your God YHWH has apportioned to all the peoples under the whole heavens."

**NRSV:**  
"Since you saw no form when the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire, watch yourselves closely, so that you do not act corruptly by making an idol for yourselves, in the form of any figure—the likeness of male or female, the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air, the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth. And when you look up to the heavens and see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, do not be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples everywhere under heaven."

## Deuteronomy 5:7-9  
**LSV:**  
"You have no other gods before Me. You do not make a carved image for yourself—any likeness which [is] in the heavens above, or which [is] in the earth beneath, or which [is] in the waters under the earth; you do not bow yourself to them nor serve them—for I, YHWH your God, [am] a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on sons to the third and to the fourth [generation] of those hating Me."

**NRSV:**  
"You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents to the third and fourth generation of those who reject me."

## Deuteronomy 7:25-26  
**LSV:**  
"You burn the carved images of their gods with fire; you do not desire the silver and gold on them, nor take [it] for yourself, lest you be snared by it—for it [is] an abomination to YHWH your God; and you do not bring an abomination into your house—then you have been devoted like it; you utterly detest it, and you utterly abhor it, for it [is] devoted."

**NRSV:**  
"The images of their gods you shall burn with fire. Do not covet the silver or the gold that is on them and take it for yourself, because you could be ensnared by it, for it is abhorrent to the LORD your God. Do not bring an abhorrent thing into your house, or you will be set apart for destruction like it. You must utterly detest and abhor it, for it is set apart for destruction."

## Deuteronomy 12:2-4  
**LSV:**  
"You utterly destroy all the places where the nations which you are dispossessing served their gods—on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree; and you have broken down their altars, and you have shattered their standing pillars, and you have burned their Asherim with fire, and you have cut down the carved images of their gods, and you have destroyed their names out of that place. You do not do so to YHWH your God."

**NRSV:**  
"You must completely destroy all the places where the nations whom you are about to dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains, on the hills, and under every leafy tree; break down their altars, smash their pillars, burn their sacred poles with fire, and cut down the idols of their gods, erasing their name from that place. You shall not worship the LORD your God in such ways."

## Deuteronomy 13:6-10  
**LSV:**  
"When your brother—the son of your mother—or your son or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who [is] as your own soul—entices you, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' (which you have not known, you and your fathers, of the gods of the peoples who [are] around you, near you or far off from you, from the end of the earth even to the end of the earth), you do not consent to him, nor listen to him; nor do your eye spare him, nor do you pity, nor conceal him; but you certainly kill him—your hand is on him first to put him to death, and the hand of all the people last; and you stone him with stones, and he has died, for he has sought to drive you away from YHWH your God who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."

**NRSV:**  
"If anyone secretly entices you—even if it is your brother, your father’s son or your mother’s son, or your own son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your most intimate friend—saying, 'Let us go worship other gods,' whom neither you nor your ancestors have known, any of the gods of the peoples who are around you, whether near you or far away, from one end of the earth to the other, you must not yield to or heed any such persons. Show them no pity or compassion and do not shield them. But you shall surely kill them; your own hand shall be first against them to execute them, and afterwards the hand of all the people. Stone them to death for trying to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."

## Deuteronomy 27:15  
**LSV:**  
"Cursed [is] the man who makes a carved or molten image—an abomination to YHWH, a work of the hands of a craftsman—and has placed [it] in a secret place; and all the people have answered and said, 'Amen.'"

**NRSV:**  
"Cursed be anyone who makes an idol, whether the work of an artisan or a cast image—an abomination to the LORD, the work of human hands—and sets it up in secret. All the people shall respond, saying, 'Amen!'"
