## Esther 3:2-5  
**LSV:**  
"And all servants of the king, who [are] in the gate of the king, are bowing and doing obeisance to Haman, for so the king commanded for him, and Mordecai has not bowed nor done obeisance. And the servants of the king who [are] in the gate of the king say to Mordecai, 'Why [are] you transgressing the command of the king?' And it comes to pass, in their speaking daily to him, and he has not listened to them, that they declare [it] to Haman, to see if the words of Mordecai stand, for he has declared to them that he [is] a Jew; and Haman sees that Mordecai is not bowing and not doing obeisance to him, and Haman is full of fury."

**NRSV:**  
"All the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and did obeisance to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance. Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, 'Why do you disobey the king’s command?' When they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai’s words would avail; for he had told them that he was a Jew. When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman was infuriated."

## Esther 4:13-14  
**LSV:**  
"And Mordecai speaks to send back to Esther: 'Do not think in your soul to be delivered [in] the house of the king, more than all the Jews, for if you keep entirely silent at this time, relief and deliverance arise for the Jews from another place, and you and the house of your father perish; and who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for a time like this?'"

**NRSV:**  
"Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, 'Do not think that in the king’s palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father’s family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such a time as this.'"

## Esther 6:6-10  
**LSV:**  
"And Haman comes in, and the king says to him, 'What [is] to be done to the man in whose honor the king delights?' And Haman says in his heart, 'To whom does the king delight to do honor more than myself?' And Haman says to the king, 'The man in whose honor the king delights, let them bring the royal clothing with which the king clothes himself, and the horse on which the king rides, and on whose head the royal crown is put; and let clothing and the horse be given into the hand of one of the king’s noble princes, and they have clothed the man in whose honor the king delights, and caused him to ride on the horse in the broad place of the city, and they have proclaimed before him, "Thus it is done to the man in whose honor the king delights."' And the king says to Haman, 'Hurry, take the clothing and the horse, as you have spoken, and do so to Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the gate of the king; do not let anything fall from all that you have spoken.'"

**NRSV:**  
"So Haman came in, and the king said to him, 'What shall be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?' Haman said to himself, 'Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?' So Haman said to the king, 'For the man whom the king wishes to honor, let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and a horse that the king has ridden, with a royal crown on its head. Let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble officials; let him robe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him conduct the man on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him, "Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor."' Then the king said to Haman, 'Quickly, take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to the Jew Mordecai who sits at the king’s gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.'"

## Esther 9:25-26  
**LSV:**  
"And in her coming in before the king, he commanded with the letter, 'Let his evil device, that he devised against the Jews, return on his own head,' and they hanged him and his sons on the tree; therefore they have called these days Purim—by the name of the lot—because of all the words of this letter, and what they have seen concerning this matter, and what has come to them."

**NRSV:**  
"But when it came before the king, he gave orders in writing that the wicked plot that Haman had devised against the Jews should come upon his own head; and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. Therefore these days are called Purim, from the word pur. Thus, because of all that was written in this letter and what they had faced in this matter, and of what had happened to them—"

## Notes  
- **Refusal to bow (Esther 3:2-5):** Mordecai’s refusal to bow to Haman may reflect a rejection of practices resembling idolatrous obeisance.
- **Providence and deliverance (Esther 4:13-14; 9:25-26):** Highlights reliance on God’s providence rather than political or pagan solutions.
- **Honor and humility (Esther 6:6-10):** Exposes prideful expectations of honor, contrasted with divine reversal.
- **God’s indirect presence:** While God is not directly mentioned in Esther, the theme of avoiding reliance on foreign gods or practices is implied in Jewish fidelity.
