**LSV:**  
"And I say to them, Cast away each the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt—I [am] your God YHWH.

## Ezekiel 23:36-39  
**LSV:**  
"And YHWH says to me, Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Declare to them their abominations. For they have committed adultery, and blood [is] in their hands, and they commit adultery with their idols, and also their sons whom they bore to Me—they caused to pass over to them for food. Again, they have done this to Me: they defiled My sanctuary in that day, and they have profaned My Sabbaths. And when they slaughtered their sons to their idols—they also come into My sanctuary in that day to defile it."

**NRSV:**  
"The LORD said to me: Mortal, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations. For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; with their idols they have committed adultery, and they have even offered up to them for food the children they had borne to me. Moreover this they have done to me: they defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my Sabbaths. For when they slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, they entered my sanctuary the same day to profane it."

## Notes  
- **Persistence in idolatry (Ezekiel 6:4-6; 8:10-12; 14:3-6; 20:7-8; 23:36-39):** Highlights Israel’s repeated turning to idols despite God’s warnings.
- **Spiritual adultery (Ezekiel 16:15-19; 23:36-39):** Idolatry is described as unfaithfulness comparable to marital infidelity.
- **Defilement of the sanctuary (Ezekiel 8:10-12; 23:39):** Idolatry contaminates even the holy places.
- **Judgment and restoration (Ezekiel 36:25-27):** While judgment comes for idolatry, God promises cleansing and renewal.
- **Heart-centered idolatry (Ezekiel 14:3):** Idolatry begins inwardly when people place other things above God.
- **Child sacrifice condemned (Ezekiel 23:36-39):** The extreme depths of idolatrous practices are rejected.
