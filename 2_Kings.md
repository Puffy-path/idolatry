## 2 Kings 1:2-4  
**LSV:**  
"And Ahaziah falls through the lattice in his upper chamber that [is] in Samaria, and becomes sick, and sends messengers, and says to them, 'Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, god of Ekron, if I revive from this sickness.' And a messenger of YHWH speaks to Elijah the Tishbite, 'Rise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and speak to them: "Is it because there is no God in Israel—you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, god of Ekron? Therefore, thus said YHWH: You do not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, for you certainly die."' And Elijah goes."

**NRSV:**  
"Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria and lay injured; so he sent messengers, telling them, 'Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury.' But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, 'Get up, go to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, "Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?" Now therefore thus says the LORD: "You shall not leave the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die."' So Elijah went."

## 2 Kings 10:18-20  
**LSV:**  
"And Jehu gathers all the people and says to them, 'Ahab served Baal a little—Jehu serves him much; and now, call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests—do not let a man be lacking, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal; everyone who is lacking—he does not live.' And Jehu has acted with cunning, in order to destroy the servants of Baal. And Jehu says, 'Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal'; and they proclaim [it]."

**NRSV:**  
"Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, 'Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much. Now therefore summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal; whoever is missing shall not live.' But Jehu was acting with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal. Jehu said, 'Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.' So they proclaimed it."

## 2 Kings 17:7-12  
**LSV:**  
"And it comes to pass, because the sons of Israel have sinned against YHWH their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and they fear other gods, and walk in the statutes of the nations that YHWH dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel, and of the kings of Israel that they made; and the sons of Israel do things covertly that [are] not right against YHWH their God, and build high places for themselves in all their cities, from the tower of the watchers to the fortified city, and set up standing-pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree, and make incense-offerings there in all high places, like the nations that YHWH removed from their presence, and do evil things to provoke YHWH, and serve the idols, of which YHWH had said to them, 'You do not do this thing.'"

**NRSV:**  
"This occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They had worshiped other gods and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs that the kings of Israel had introduced. The people of Israel secretly did things that were not right against the LORD their God. They built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city; they set up pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree; there they made offerings on all the high places, as the nations did whom the LORD carried away before them. They did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger; they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, 'You shall not do this.'"

## 2 Kings 17:16-17  
**LSV:**  
"And they forsake all the commands of their God YHWH, and make molten images for themselves—two calves—and make an Asherah, and bow themselves to all the host of the heavens, and serve Baal, and cause their sons and their daughters to pass over into fire, and use divinations and enchantments, and sell themselves to do evil in the eyes of YHWH, to provoke Him."

**NRSV:**  
"They rejected all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves cast images of two calves; they made a sacred pole, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. They made their sons and their daughters pass through fire; they practiced divination and augury; and they sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger."

## 2 Kings 21:2-6  
**LSV:**  
"And he does evil in the eyes of YHWH, according to the abominations of the nations that YHWH dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel, and he turns and builds the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed, and raises altars for Baal, and makes an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and bows himself to all the host of the heavens, and serves them. And he has built altars in the house of YHWH, of which YHWH said, 'In Jerusalem I put My Name.' And he builds altars for all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of YHWH; and he has caused his son to pass over into fire, and has practiced hidden arts and used divination, and has dealt with familiar spirits and with wizards; he has multiplied doing evil in the eyes of YHWH to provoke Him."

**NRSV:**  
"He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, following the abominable practices of the nations that the LORD drove out before the people of Israel. For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he erected altars for Baal, made a sacred pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them. He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, 'In Jerusalem I will put my name.' He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. He made his son pass through fire; he practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger."

And he has broken down the houses of the male temple prostitutes that [are] in the house of YHWH, where the women are weaving houses for the Asherah."

**NRSV:**  
"The king commanded the high priest Hilkiah, the priests of the second order, and the guardians of the threshold to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.
