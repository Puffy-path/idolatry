- **Vanity and falsehood (Psalms 24:3-4; 31:6):** Equates idolatry with deceit and emptiness.
- **Idols vs. the Creator (Psalms 96:4-5; 135:15-18):** Contrasts the lifeless nature of idols with YHWH, the living Creator.
- **Historical reference (Psalm 106:19-21):** Recalls the golden calf incident as a key example of Israel’s idolatry.
- **Consequences of idolatry:** Idolatry leads to spiritual blindness and lifelessness, making worshipers like the idols they trust.
