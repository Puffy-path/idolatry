## Haggai 1:4-6  
**LSV:**  
"Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your covered houses, and this house [is] a ruin? And now, thus said YHWH of Hosts: Set your heart to your ways. You have sown much, and brought in little, || Eat, and it is not for satiety, || Drink, and it is not for drunkenness, || You clothe yourselves, and it is not for warmth to him, || And he who is hiring himself out—is hiring himself out for a bag pierced through."

**NRSV:**  
"Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? Now therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider how you have fared. You have sown much, and harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and you that earn wages earn wages to put them into a bag with holes."

## Haggai 1:9-11  
**LSV:**  
"Looking for much, and behold little, || And you brought [it] home, and I blew on it, || Why? A declaration of YHWH of Hosts, || Because of My house that is waste, || And you are running—each to his house, || Therefore, over you the heavens have kept back from dew, || And the land has kept back its increase. And I call for a drought on the land, || And on the mountains, and on the grain, || And on the new wine, and on the oil, || And on that which the ground brings forth, || And on man, and on beast, || And on all labor of the hands."

**NRSV:**  
"You have looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the LORD of hosts. Because my house lies in ruins, while all of you hurry off to your own houses. Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the soil produces, on human beings and animals, and on all their labors."

## Haggai 2:6-9  
**LSV:**  
"For thus said YHWH of Hosts: Yet once—it [is] a little, || And I am shaking the heavens and the earth, || And the sea, and the dry land, || And I have shaken all the nations, || And they have come [to] the desirable things of all the nations, || And I have filled this house [with] glory, said YHWH of Hosts. The silver [is] Mine, and the gold [is] Mine, || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts. Greater is the glory of this latter house || Than of the former, said YHWH of Hosts, || And in this place I give peace, || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts."

**NRSV:**  
"For thus says the LORD of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land; and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the LORD of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts. The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the LORD of hosts."

## Notes  
- **Neglecting God’s house as practical idolatry (Haggai 1:4-6, 1:9-11):** Prioritizing personal comfort over God’s temple reflects a form of misplaced devotion.
- **Dependence on material wealth rebuked (Haggai 2:6-9):** God reminds the people that silver and gold belong to Him, cautioning against material idolatry.
- **Divine judgment for misplaced priorities:** The people’s hardships are directly connected to neglecting God’s work, echoing the consequences of spiritual unfaithfulness.
- **Call to repentance through action:** Rebuilding the temple symbolizes returning to proper worship and honoring God above all else.
- **God’s ultimate sovereignty:** Despite material desires, only God can provide true peace and prosperity.
