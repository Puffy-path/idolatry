## Joshua 7:10-13  
**LSV:**  
"And YHWH says to Joshua, 'Rise, why [is] this—you are falling on your face? Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them, and they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and also deceived, and also put [it] among their vessels, and the sons of Israel have not been able to stand before their enemies; they turn the neck before their enemies, because they have become devoted; I am not adding to be with you if you do not destroy the devoted thing out of your midst. Rise, sanctify the people, and you have said, "Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus said YHWH, God of Israel: There is a devoted thing in your midst, O Israel; you are not able to stand before your enemies until you turn aside the devoted thing from your midst."'"

**NRSV:**  
"The LORD said to Joshua, 'Stand up! Why have you fallen upon your face? Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I imposed on them. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their own belongings. Therefore, the Israelites are unable to stand before their enemies; they turn their backs to their enemies because they have become a thing devoted for destruction. I will be with you no more unless you destroy the devoted things from among you. Rise up, sanctify the people, and say, "Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: There are devoted things among you, O Israel; you will be unable to stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you."'"

## Joshua 23:6-8  
**LSV:**  
"And you have been very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Scroll of the Law of Moses, so as not to turn aside from it [to] the right or left, so as not to go among these nations, these who are left with you, and of the names of their gods you do not mention, nor cause to swear [by them], nor serve them, nor bow yourselves to them; but you cleave to your God YHWH, as you have done to this day."

**NRSV:**  
"Therefore be very steadfast to observe and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right nor to the left, so that you may not be mixed with these nations left here among you; you shall not mention the names of their gods, or swear by them, or serve them, or bow yourselves to them, but hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day."

## Joshua 23:12-13  
**LSV:**  
"For—if you at all turn back and have cleaved to the remnant of these nations, these who are left with you, and intermarry with them, and go into them, and they into you—know certainly that your God YHWH is not adding to dispossess these nations from before you, and they have been to you for a snare, and for a trap, and for a scourge in your sides, and for thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good ground which your God YHWH has given to you."

**NRSV:**  
"For if you turn back and join the survivors of these nations left here among you, and intermarry with them, so that you marry their women and they yours, know assuredly that the LORD your God will not continue to drive out these nations before you; but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a scourge on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the LORD your God has given you."

## Joshua 24:14-15  
**LSV:**  
"And now, fear YHWH, and serve Him in perfection and in truth, and turn aside the gods which your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve YHWH; and if [it is] evil in your eyes to serve YHWH, choose for yourselves today whom you serve—whether the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorite in whose land you are dwelling; but I and my house—we serve YHWH."

**NRSV:**  
"Now therefore revere the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods that your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. Now if you are unwilling to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD."

## Joshua 24:19-20  
**LSV:**  
"And Joshua says to the people, 'You are not able to serve YHWH, for He [is] a holy God; He [is] a zealous God—He does not bear with your transgression and with your sins; when you forsake YHWH, and have served strange gods, then He has turned and done evil to you, and consumed you, after He has done good to you.'"

**NRSV:**  
"But Joshua said to the people, 'You cannot serve the LORD, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good.'"

## Joshua 24:23  
**LSV:**  
"And now, turn aside the strange gods which [are] among you, and incline your heart to YHWH, God of Israel."

**NRSV:**  
"He said, 'Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.'"
