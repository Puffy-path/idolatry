"And the sons of Israel do evil in the eyes of YHWH, and serve the Ba‘alim, and forsake YHWH, God of their fathers, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who [are] around them, and bow themselves to them, and provoke YHWH; indeed, they forsake YHWH, and serve Ba‘al and Ashtaroth."

**NRSV:**  
"Then the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and worshiped the Baals; and they abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; they followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were all around them, and bowed down to them; and they provoked the LORD to anger. They abandoned the LORD, and worshiped Baal and the Astartes."

**NRSV:**  
"So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and they took their daughters as wives for themselves, and their own daughters they gave to their sons; and they worshiped their gods. The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, forgetting the LORD their God, and worshiping the Baals and the Asherahs."

## Judges 10:6-7  
**LSV:**  
"And the sons of Israel add to do evil in the eyes of YHWH, and serve the Ba‘alim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsake YHWH, and have not served Him; and the anger of YHWH burns against Israel, and He sells them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the sons of Ammon."

**NRSV:**  
"The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, worshiping the Baals and the Astartes, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines; thus they abandoned the LORD and did not worship him. So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites."

## Judges 17:3-6  
**LSV:**  
"And he gives back the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother says, 'I have certainly dedicated the silver to YHWH out of my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a molten image; and now, I give it back to you.' And he gives back the silver to his mother, and his mother takes two hundred pieces of silver, and gives them to a refiner, and he makes it a carved image and a molten image, and it is in the house of Micah. As for the man Micah—he has a house of gods—so he makes an ephod and teraphim, and consecrates one of his sons, and he is to him for a priest. In those days there is no king in Israel; each does that which is right in his own eyes."

**NRSV:**  
"When he gave the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, his mother said, 'I consecrate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make an idol of cast metal.' So when he returned the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith, who made it into an idol of cast metal; and it was in the house of Micah. This man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and teraphim, and installed one of his sons, who became his priest. In those days there was no king in Israel; all the people did what was right in their own eyes."

## Judges 18:14-17  
**LSV:**  
"And the five men who are going to spy out the land of Laish answer and say to their brothers, 'Have you known that there are in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a carved image, and a molten image? And now, know what you do.' And they turn aside there, and come to the house of the young man—the Levite—to the house of Micah, and ask him of welfare. And the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, who [are] of the sons of Dan, are stationed at the opening of the gate, and the five men who are going to spy out the land go up—they have come in there—they take the carved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, and the priest is standing at the opening of the gate, and the six hundred men girded with weapons of war."

**NRSV:**  
"Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land (that is, Laish) said to their comrades, 'Do you know that in these buildings there are an ephod, teraphim, and an idol of cast metal? Now therefore consider what you will do.' So they turned aside and came to the house of the young Levite at the home of Micah, and asked him how he was doing. Now the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate. The five men who had gone to spy out the land proceeded to enter and take the idol of cast metal, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war."
