## Lamentations 1:8-9  
**LSV:**  
"Jerusalem has sinned greatly, || Therefore she has become impure, || All honoring her have despised her, || For they have seen her nakedness, || She also sighs and turns backward. Her uncleanness [is] in her skirts, || She has not remembered her latter end, || And she comes down wonderfully, || There is no comforter for her. 'See, O YHWH, my affliction, || For an enemy has exerted himself.'"

**NRSV:**  
"Jerusalem sinned grievously, so she has become a mockery; all who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns her face away. Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she took no thought of her future; her downfall was appalling, with none to comfort her. 'O LORD, look at my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed!'"

## Lamentations 1:10-11  
**LSV:**  
"The adversary has spread out his hand over all her desirable things, || For she has seen nations || She has seen nations enter into her sanctuary, || Concerning which You commanded, || They do not come into the assembly to You. All her people are sighing, seeking bread, || They have given their desirable things for food || To refresh the soul. See, O YHWH, and behold, || How I have been lightly esteemed."

**NRSV:**  
"The enemy has stretched out his hands over all her precious things; she has even seen the nations invade her sanctuary, those whom you forbade to enter your congregation. All her people groan as they search for bread; they trade their treasures for food to revive their strength. Look, O LORD, and see how worthless I have become."

## Lamentations 2:5-7  
**LSV:**  
"The Lord has been as an enemy, || He has swallowed up Israel, || He has swallowed up all her palaces, || He has destroyed his fortresses, || And multiplies in the daughter of Judah || Mourning and moaning. And He casts down His tabernacle as a garden, || He has destroyed His appointed place, || YHWH has caused appointed meeting and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion, || And despises king and priest || In the indignation of His anger. The Lord has kicked against His altar, || He has rejected His sanctuary, || He has delivered the walls of her palaces || Into the hand of the enemy, || They have given a noise in the house of YHWH || As [on] the day of an appointed meeting."

**NRSV:**  
"The Lord has become like an enemy; he has destroyed Israel. He has destroyed all its palaces, laid in ruins its strongholds, and multiplied in daughter Judah mourning and lamentation. He has broken down his booth like a garden; he has destroyed his tabernacle; the LORD has abolished in Zion festival and Sabbath, and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest. The Lord has scorned his altar, disowned his sanctuary; he has delivered into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; a clamor was raised in the house of the LORD as on a day of festival."

## Lamentations 4:13-15  
**LSV:**  
"Because of the sins of her prophets, || The iniquities of her priests, || Who have shed innocent blood in her midst. They have wandered blind in out-places, || They have been defiled with blood, || Without [any] being able to touch their clothing. 'Turn aside! Unclean!' they called at them, || 'Turn aside! Turn aside, do not touch!' || For they have fled, indeed, they have wandered, || They have said among nations: || 'They do not add to sojourn.'"

**NRSV:**  
"This was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in the midst of her. Blindly they wandered through the streets, so defiled with blood that no one was able to touch their garments. 'Away! Unclean!' people shouted at them; 'Away! Away! Do not touch!' So they became fugitives and wanderers; it was said among the nations, 'They shall stay here no longer.'"

## Lamentations 5:16-17  
**LSV:**  
"The crown has fallen from our head, || Woe [is] now to us, for we have sinned. For this has our heart been sick, || For these our eyes have been dim."

**NRSV:**  
"The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned! Because of this our hearts are sick, because of these things our eyes have grown dim."

## Notes  
- **Implied idolatry through judgment (Lamentations 1:8-11; 2:5-7):** The destruction of Jerusalem and the temple is portrayed as a result of Israel’s collective sin, which historically included idolatry.
- **Defilement of the sanctuary (Lamentations 1:10; 2:7):** Foreign invaders entering the temple alludes to God’s judgment for the people’s unfaithfulness.
- **Prophetic and priestly failure (Lamentations 4:13-15):** Leaders, who were supposed to guide against idolatry, contributed to the nation’s downfall.
- **Consequences of sin (Lamentations 5:16-17):** Acknowledges the spiritual and national consequences of abandoning God.
- **Lack of direct references:** While Lamentations does not directly mention idol worship, the context of the Babylonian invasion ties back to warnings against idolatry found in earlier prophetic books.
