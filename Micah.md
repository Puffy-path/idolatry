## Micah 1:5-7  
**LSV:**  
"All this [is] for the transgression of Jacob, || And for the sins of the house of Israel. || What [is] the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? || And what [are] the high places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? And I have made Samaria become a heap of the field, || For the planting of vineyards, || And poured out her stones to the valley, || And I uncover her foundations. And all her carved images are beaten down, || And all her wages are burned with fire, || And I make all her idols a desolation, || For she gathered from the wages of a harlot, || And they return to the wages of a harlot."

**NRSV:**  
"All this is for the transgression of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem? Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour down her stones into the valley and uncover her foundations. All her images shall be beaten to pieces, all her wages shall be burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay waste; for as the wages of a prostitute she gathered them, and as the wages of a prostitute they shall again be used."

## Micah 3:5-7  
**LSV:**  
"Thus said YHWH concerning the prophets || Who are causing My people to err, || Who are biting with their teeth, and have cried 'Peace,' || And he who does not put into their mouths—they have sanctified against him war. Therefore, night is to you from a vision, || And darkness to you from divination, || And the sun has gone down on the prophets, || And the day has been black over them. And the seers are ashamed, || And the diviners blush, || And all of them cover over their upper lip, || For there is no answer from God."

**NRSV:**  
"Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who cry 'Peace' when they have something to eat, but declare war against those who put nothing into their mouths. Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision, and darkness to you, without revelation. The sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them; the seers shall be disgraced, and the diviners put to shame; they shall all cover their lips, for there is no answer from God."

## Micah 5:10-14  
**LSV:**  
"And it has come to pass in that day, || A declaration of YHWH, || I have cut off your horses from your midst, || And I destroy your chariots, || And have cut off the cities of your land, || And I have thrown down all your fortresses, || And have cut off sorcerers out of your hand, || And there are no soothsayers to you. And I have cut off your carved images and your standing pillars out of your midst, || And you no longer bow yourself to the work of your hands. And I have plucked up your shrines out of your midst, || And I have destroyed your cities."

**NRSV:**  
"On that day, says the LORD, I will cut off your horses from among you and will destroy your chariots; and I will cut off the cities of your land and throw down all your strongholds; and I will cut off sorceries from your hand, and you shall have no more soothsayers; and I will cut off your images and your pillars from among you, and you shall bow down no more to the work of your hands; and I will uproot your sacred poles from among you and destroy your towns."

## Micah 6:6-8  
**LSV:**  
"With what do I come before YHWH? Bow myself to the Most High God? || Do I come before Him with burnt-offerings? With calves—sons of a year? Is YHWH pleased with thousands of rams? With myriads of streams of oil? Do I give my firstborn [for] my transgression? The fruit of my body [for] the sin of my soul? He has declared to you, O man, what [is] good; || And what is YHWH requiring of you, || Except—to do judgment, and love kindness, || And to walk humbly with your God?"

**NRSV:**  
"With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"
