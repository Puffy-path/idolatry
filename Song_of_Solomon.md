## Song of Songs: No Direct Mentions of Idolatry  
The **Song of Songs** does not contain explicit references to idolatry, false gods, or forbidden religious practices. Its primary focus is on the poetic exploration of love, commitment, and beauty within a covenantal relationship.

---

## Possible Symbolic Interpretations  
While the book does not mention idolatry directly, some interpretations see certain metaphors and contrasts as symbolic warnings against spiritual unfaithfulness, which can be associated with idolatry in biblical literature. However, these interpretations are largely allegorical and not explicitly stated in the text.

---

## Notes  
- **No direct references:** The Song of Songs focuses on human love and covenant imagery rather than addressing idol worship or false religious practices.
- **Spiritual allegory (traditional view):** Some theological traditions interpret the relationship between the lovers as a metaphor for the relationship between God and His people, where unfaithfulness in such a context could indirectly allude to spiritual idolatry.
- **Context within biblical canon:** While this book is rich in poetic language, it stands apart from other wisdom and prophetic books that regularly confront idolatry.
