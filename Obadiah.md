## Obadiah 1:3-4  
**LSV:**  
"The pride of your heart has lifted you up, || Dwelling in clefts of the rock, || The high place of his habitation, || Saying in his heart, 'Who brings me down to the earth?' If you soar high as an eagle, || And if you set your nest among stars, || From there I bring you down, || A declaration of YHWH."

**NRSV:**  
"Your proud heart has deceived you, you that live in the clefts of the rock, whose dwelling is in the heights. You say in your heart, 'Who will bring me down to the ground?' Though you soar aloft like the eagle, though your nest is set among the stars, from there I will bring you down, says the LORD."

## Obadiah 1:7  
**LSV:**  
"All the men of your covenant have sent you to the border, || The men of your peace have deceived you, || They have prevailed over you, || They are making your bread a snare under you— || There is no understanding in him!"

**NRSV:**  
"All your allies have deceived you, they have driven you to the border; your confederates have prevailed against you; those who ate your bread have set a trap for you—there is no understanding of it."

## Obadiah 1:15-16  
**LSV:**  
"For the Day of YHWH [is] near against all the nations, || As you have done, it is done to you, || Your deed turns back on your head. For as you have drunk on My holy mountain, || All the nations drink continually, || And they have drunk and have swallowed, || And they have been as [those] who have not been."

**NRSV:**  
"For the day of the LORD is near against all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head. For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, all the nations around you shall drink; they shall drink and gulp down, and shall be as though they had never been."

## Notes  
- **Pride as idolatry (Obadiah 1:3-4):** Exalting oneself above God is a form of self-idolatry, which leads to judgment.
- **False alliances and misplaced trust (Obadiah 1:7):** Trusting in human alliances over God reflects a kind of idolatry of worldly power.
- **Judgment against nations (Obadiah 1:15-16):** Nations that act arrogantly and violently, often accompanied by idol worship, face divine retribution.
- **Implied rejection of false security:** Edom’s reliance on its strongholds and alliances mirrors spiritual misplaced trust, a common theme in biblical condemnations of idolatry.
- **God’s sovereignty emphasized:** No human power or prideful elevation can rival God’s authority.
