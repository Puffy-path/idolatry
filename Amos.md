**NRSV:**

## Amos 4:4-5  
**LSV:**  
"Enter Beth-El—and transgress, || At Gilgal—multiply transgression, || And bring in your sacrifices in the morning, || Your tithes after three days. And perfume with leaven a thanksgiving offering, || And proclaim willing gifts—make known! For so you have loved, O sons of Israel, || A declaration of Lord YHWH."

**NRSV:**  
"Come to Bethel—and transgress; to Gilgal—and multiply transgression; bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days; bring a thank offering of leavened bread, and proclaim freewill offerings, publish them; for so you love to do, O people of Israel! says the Lord GOD."

**LSV:**

**NRSV:**

## Amos 5:21-23  
**LSV:**  
"I have hated—I have loathed your festivals, || And I am not refreshed by your assemblies. For though you cause burnt-offerings and your presents to ascend to Me, || I do not accept, || And I do not behold the peace-offerings of your fatlings. Turn aside from Me the noise of your songs, || Indeed, I do not hear the melody of your stringed instruments."

**NRSV:**  
"I hate, I despise your festivals, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; and the offerings of well-being of your fatted animals I will not look upon. Take away from me the noise of your songs; I will not listen to the melody of your harps."
