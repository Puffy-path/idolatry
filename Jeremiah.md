## Jeremiah 2:11-13  
**LSV:**  
"Has a nation changed gods? (And they [are] no gods!) And My people have changed their glory for that which does not profit. Be astonished, O heavens, at this, || Yea, be frightened, be greatly wasted, || A declaration of YHWH. For My people have done two evils: They have forsaken Me, a fountain of living waters, || To hew out for themselves wells—broken wells, that do not contain the waters."

**NRSV:**  
"Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for something that does not profit. Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the LORD, for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that can hold no water."

## Jeremiah 7:9-10  
**LSV:**  
"Do you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and make incense to Ba‘al, and walk after other gods whom you have not known—then you have come in and stood before Me in this house on which My Name is called, and have said, ‘We have been delivered’—in order to do all these abominations?"

**NRSV:**  
"Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are safe!’—only to go on doing all these abominations?"

## Jeremiah 10:3-5  
**LSV:**  
"For the statutes of the peoples are vanity, || For it [is] a tree cut from a forest, || Work of the hands of a craftsman with an axe, || They beautify it with silver and with gold, || They fix it with nails and with hammers, || And it does not stumble. They [are] stiff as a palm, and they do not speak, || They are surely carried, for they do not step, || Do not fear them, for they do no evil, || Indeed, to do good is also not in them."

**NRSV:**  
"For the customs of the peoples are false: a tree from the forest is cut down, and worked with an ax by the hands of an artisan; people deck it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move. Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, nor is it in them to do good."

## Jeremiah 11:10-12  
**LSV:**  
"They have turned back to the iniquities of their first fathers, || Who refused to listen to My words, || And they have gone after other gods to serve them; The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant that I made with their fathers. Therefore, thus said YHWH: Behold, I am bringing calamity on them, || That they are not able to go out from it, || And they have cried to Me, || And I do not listen to them. And the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem have gone, || And they have cried to the gods to whom they are making incense, || And they do not save them at all in the time of their calamity."

**NRSV:**  
"They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors of old, who refused to heed my words. They themselves have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant that I made with their ancestors. Therefore thus says the LORD: Assuredly I am going to bring disaster upon them that they cannot escape; though they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they will not be able to save them in the time of their trouble."

## Jeremiah 16:20  
**LSV:**  
"Does man make gods for himself? Indeed, they are no gods!"

**NRSV:**  
"Can mortals make for themselves gods? Such are no gods!"

---

## Jeremiah 19:4-5  
**LSV:**  
"Because that they have forsaken Me, || And make this place strange, || And make incense in it to other gods, || That neither they, nor their fathers, nor kings of Judah have known, || And they have filled this place with innocent blood, || And have built the high places of Ba‘al to burn their sons with fire, || Burnt-offerings to Ba‘al, that I did not command, nor spoke of, nor came up on My heart."

**NRSV:**  
"Because the people have forsaken me, and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods, whom neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah have known, and because they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent, and gone on building the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal—which I did not command or decree, nor did it enter my mind—"

"And they set their abominations in the house over which My Name is called, to defile it, and they have built the high places of Ba‘al that [are] in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, || To cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech—That I did not command them, nor did it come up into My heart, || To do this abomination to cause Judah to sin."

**NRSV:**  
"They set up their abominations in the house that bears my name, and defiled it. They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter my mind that they should do this abomination, causing Judah to sin."
