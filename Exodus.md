## Exodus 20:3-5

"You have no other gods before Me. You do not make a carved image for yourself, or any likeness which [is] in the heavens above, or which [is] in the earth beneath, or which [is] in the waters under the earth; you do not bow yourself to them, nor serve them, for I—YHWH your God—[am] a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on children, on the third [generation] and on the fourth [generation] of those hating Me."

**NRSV:**  
"You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me."
