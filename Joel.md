## Joel 2:12-13  
**LSV:**  
"And now—return to Me with all your heart, || And with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation. And tear your heart, and not your garments, || And turn back to YHWH your God, || For He [is] gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in kindness, || And relents of evil."

**NRSV:**  
"Yet even now, says the LORD, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; rend your hearts and not your clothing. Return to the LORD, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and relents from punishing."

**NRSV:**  
"Between the vestibule and the altar let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep. Let them say, 'Spare your people, O LORD, and do not make your heritage a mockery, a byword among the nations. Why should it be said among the peoples, "Where is their God?"'"

## Notes  
- **Implicit condemnation of false worship (Joel 3:5):** Refers to foreign nations taking God’s treasures into their temples, suggesting idolatrous misuse.
- **Call to genuine repentance (Joel 2:12-13):** Turning from all falsehoods, including idolatry, is implied in the call to return to God wholeheartedly.
- **Shame among the nations (Joel 2:17):** Reflects the consequences of turning from God, which often included idol worship in Israel’s history.
- **Desolation as divine judgment (Joel 3:19):** Highlights God’s judgment on nations that oppose His people, often associated with idolatry and violence.
- **Focus on restoration:** While direct mentions of idols are few, the emphasis on returning to God suggests the rejection of all competing loyalties.
