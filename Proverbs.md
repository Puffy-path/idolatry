## Notes  
- **False worship and empty rituals (Proverbs 15:8-9; 21:27; 28:9):** Emphasizes that outward religious acts are meaningless without obedience to God.
- **Self-reliance vs. trusting God (Proverbs 3:5-7; 16:2-5):** Warns against relying on personal wisdom, which can lead to idolatry of self.
- **Hidden idolatry (Proverbs 14:12):** Suggests that seemingly right paths (including false religious practices) can lead to spiritual death.
- **Pride as spiritual rebellion (Proverbs 16:5):** Pride is equated with idolatrous self-exaltation, which God opposes.
- **Reverence and obedience:** True worship of God involves both reverence (fear of YHWH) and obedience to His commands.
