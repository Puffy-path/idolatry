## Genesis 35:2-4  
**LSV:**  
"And Jacob says to his household, and to all who [are] with him, 'Turn aside the gods of the stranger which [are] in your midst, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments; and we rise and go up to Bethel, and I make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way that I have gone.' And they give to Jacob all the gods of the stranger that [are] in their hand, and the rings that [are] in their ears, and Jacob hides them under the oak which [is] by Shechem."

**NRSV:**  
"So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, 'Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your clothes; then come, let us go up to Bethel, so that I may make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.' So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak that was near Shechem."

"Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it. So Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel."

## Notes  
- **Teraphim:** Refers to household idols or small cultic objects (LSV), translated as "household gods" in the NRSV.
- **Foreign gods:** Frequently used to denote idolatry and non-Yahwistic religious objects.
- **Pillars:** While Jacob sets up a pillar to God (permitted in patriarchal times), later Israelite law forbids similar practices when used for idolatry.
