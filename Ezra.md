## Ezra 4:1-3  
**LSV:**  
"And adversaries of Judah and Benjamin hear that the sons of the captivity are building a temple to YHWH, God of Israel, and they draw near to Zerubbabel and to heads of the fathers, and say to them, 'Let us build with you, for we seek your God as you [do], and to Him we have been sacrificing since the days of Esarhaddon king of Asshur, who brought us up here.' And Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel say to them, 'You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God, for we ourselves together build to YHWH, God of Israel, as King Cyrus king of Persia commanded us.'"

**NRSV:**  
"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the LORD, the God of Israel, they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of families and said to them, 'Let us build with you, for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever since the days of King Esarhaddon of Assyria who brought us here.' But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of families in Israel said to them, 'You shall have no part with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus of Persia has commanded us.'"

## Ezra 9:1-2  
**LSV:**  
"And at the completion of these things, the heads draw near to me, saying, 'The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not been separated from the peoples of the lands, whose abominations [are] as those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites, for they have taken of their daughters to themselves and to their sons, and the holy seed has been mixed among the peoples of the lands, and the hand of the heads and the authorities has been first in this trespass.'"

**NRSV:**  
"After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, 'The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons. Thus the holy seed has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands, and in this faithlessness the officials and leaders have led the way.'"

## Ezra 9:11-12  
**LSV:**  
"Which You commanded by the hand of Your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land into which you are going to possess—it [is] a land of impurity, by the impurity of the peoples of the lands, by their abominations with which they have filled it from mouth to mouth with their uncleanness; and now, do not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace and their good for all time, so that you are strong, and have eaten the good of the land, and given possession to your sons forever.'"

**NRSV:**  
"Which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land that you are entering to possess is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness. Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, so that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.'"

## Ezra 10:10-11  
**LSV:**  
"And Ezra the priest rises and says to them, 'You—you have trespassed, and you cause to dwell strange women, to add to the guilt of Israel; and now, make confession to YHWH, God of your fathers, and do His good pleasure, and be separated from the peoples of the land, and from the strange women.'"

**NRSV:**  
"And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, 'You have trespassed and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel. Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do his will; separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.'"

## Notes  
- **Rejection of syncretism (Ezra 4:1-3):** Israel refuses to blend worship of YHWH with the practices of surrounding peoples.
- **Purity and separation (Ezra 6:21; 9:1-2, 11-12; 10:10-11):** Emphasizes the importance of remaining distinct from idolatrous nations through marriage and worship practices.
- **Abominations and uncleanness:** Consistently linked to idolatry and forbidden religious customs.
- **Holiness of the community:** Maintaining purity was vital to preserve covenantal relationship with God.
