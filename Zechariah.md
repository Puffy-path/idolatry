## Zechariah 10:2  
**LSV:**  
"Because the teraphim spoke iniquity, || And the diviners have seen a lie, || And have told dreams of vanity, || They comfort [in] vain, || Therefore they have journeyed as a flock, || They are afflicted, for there is no shepherd."

**NRSV:**  
"For the teraphim utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; the dreamers tell false dreams, and give empty consolation. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they suffer for lack of a shepherd."

## Zechariah 11:17  
**LSV:**  
"Woe to the worthless shepherd, || Leaving the flock! || A sword [is] on his arm, and on his right eye, || His arm is utterly dried up, || And his right eye is utterly darkened!"

**NRSV:**  
"Oh, my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! Let his arm be completely withered, his right eye utterly blinded!"

## Zechariah 13:1-2  
**LSV:**  
"In that day there is a fountain opened || To the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, || For sin and for impurity. And it has come to pass in that day, || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts, || I cut off the names of the idols from the land, || And they are not remembered anymore, || And I also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land."

**NRSV:**  
"On that day a fountain shall be opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity. On that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, so that they shall be remembered no more; and also I will remove from the land the prophets and the unclean spirit."

## Zechariah 13:3-4  
**LSV:**  
"And it has come to pass, when a man still prophesies, || His father and his mother, his parents, have said to him, || ‘You do not live, for you have spoken falsehood in the Name of YHWH,’ || And his father and his mother, his parents, have pierced him through, in his prophesying. And it has come to pass in that day, || The prophets are ashamed, each of his vision in his prophesying, || And they do not put on a hairy robe to lie."

**NRSV:**  
"And if anyone still prophesies, their father and mother who bore them will say to them, ‘You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the LORD’; and their father and mother who bore them shall pierce them through when they prophesy. On that day the prophets will be ashamed, every one of them, of their visions when they prophesy; they will not put on a hairy mantle in order to deceive."

- **Condemnation of divination and false visions (Zechariah 10:2):** False sources of guidance such as teraphim (household idols) and diviners lead people astray.
- **Judgment on false shepherds (Zechariah 11:17):** Leaders who neglect or mislead God’s people face divine retribution, often associated with idolatry or false religion.
- **Removal of idols and unclean spirits (Zechariah 13:1-2):** God promises to purge the land of idols and the false prophets connected to them.
- **False prophecy condemned (Zechariah 13:3-4):** Speaking lies in God’s name is equated with spiritual corruption and is severely punished.
- **Call to purity and true worship:** The emphasis is on cleansing from sin and turning away from all forms of idolatry.
