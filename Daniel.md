**LSV:**  
"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego have answered, indeed, they are saying to King Nebuchadnezzar: 'We have no need to answer you concerning this matter.

And if not—be it known to you, O king, that we are not serving your gods, and we do not pay homage to the golden image that you have raised up.'"

**NRSV:**  
"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, 'O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to present a defense to you in this matter.

But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods and we will not worship the golden statue that you have set up.'"

**NRSV:**  
"And you, Belshazzar his son, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this! You have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven! The vessels of his temple have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have been drinking wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know; but the God in whose power is your very breath, and to whom belong all your ways, you have not honored."

## Daniel 6:7-10  
**LSV:**  
"All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the princes, counselors, and governors, have taken counsel together to establish a royal statute and to strengthen a strict interdict: that any who seek a petition from any god or man for thirty days except from you, O king, is cast into a den of lions. Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it is not to be changed... And Daniel, when he has known that the writing is signed, has gone up to his house, and the windows being opened in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem, three times in a day he is kneeling on his knees, and praying, and confessing before his God, as he has been doing before this."

**NRSV:**  
"All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an interdict that whoever prays to anyone, divine or human, for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into a den of lions. Now, O king, establish the interdict and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed... Although Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he continued to go to his house, which had windows in its upper room open toward Jerusalem, and to get down on his knees three times a day to pray to his God and praise him, just as he had done previously."

## Daniel 11:36-37  
**LSV:**  
"And the king has done according to his will, and he exalts himself, and magnifies himself above every god, and speaks wonderful things against the God of gods, and prospers until the indignation is completed, for that which is determined has been done. And he does not attend to the gods of his fathers, nor to the desire of women, nor does he attend to any god, for he magnifies himself above all."

**NRSV:**  
"The king shall act as he pleases. He shall exalt himself and consider himself greater than any god, and shall speak horrendous things against the God of gods. He shall prosper until the period of wrath is completed, for what is determined shall be done. He shall pay no respect to the gods of his ancestors, or to the one beloved by women; he shall not pay respect to any other god, for he shall consider himself greater than all."

- **Faithful resistance (Daniel 3:16-18; 6:10):** Shows the courage of believers who refuse to compromise.
- **Pride as a form of idolatry (Daniel 4:30-31; 11:36-37):** Exalting oneself above God is condemned.
- **False gods contrasted with the living God (Daniel 5:22-23):** Praising lifeless idols is shown as foolishness.
- **Ultimate sovereignty of God:** Despite human attempts at self-exaltation or idol creation, God’s authority prevails.
