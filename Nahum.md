## Nahum 3:4-6  
**LSV:**  
"Because of the abundance of the whoredoms of the harlot, || The goodness of the grace of her whoredoms, || Who is selling nations by her whoredoms, || And families by her sorceries, || Behold, I [am] against you, || A declaration of YHWH of Hosts, || And have uncovered your skirts before your face, || And have shown nations your nakedness, || And kingdoms your shame, || And have cast abominations on you, || And dishonored you, and made you as a sight."

**NRSV:**  
"Because of the countless debaucheries of the prostitute, gracefully alluring, mistress of sorceries, who enslaves nations through her debaucheries, and peoples through her sorceries, I am against you, says the LORD of hosts, and will lift up your skirts over your face; and I will let nations look on your nakedness and kingdoms on your shame; I will throw filth at you and treat you with contempt, and make you a spectacle."

## Nahum 3:18-19  
**LSV:**  
"Your shepherds have slumbered, O king of Asshur, || Your nobles lie down, || Your people have been scattered on the mountains, || And there is no one gathering. There is no weakening of your destruction, || Your striking [is] grievous, || All hearing your report have clapped the hand over you, || For over whom has your wickedness not passed continually?"

**NRSV:**  
"Your shepherds are asleep, O king of Assyria; your nobles slumber. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them. There is no assuaging your hurt; your wound is mortal. All who hear the news about you clap their hands over you. For who has ever escaped your endless cruelty?"
