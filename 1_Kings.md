## 1 Kings 11:4-8  
**LSV:**  
"And it comes to pass, at the time of Solomon's old age, his wives have inclined his heart after other gods, and his heart has not been perfect with his God YHWH, like the heart of his father David; and Solomon goes after Ashtoreth, goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites; and Solomon does evil in the eyes of YHWH, and has not been fully after YHWH, like his father David. Then Solomon builds a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that [is] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the sons of Ammon; and so he has done for all his foreign wives, who are making incense and sacrificing to their gods."

**NRSV:**  
"For when Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of his father David. For Solomon followed Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and did not completely follow the LORD, as his father David had done. Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. He did the same for all his foreign wives, who offered incense and sacrificed to their gods."

"And the king takes counsel, and makes two calves of gold, and says to them, 'It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold, your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!' And he sets the one in Bethel, and the other he has put in Dan; and this thing becomes a sin, and the people go before the one—to Dan."

**NRSV:**  
"So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. He said to the people, 'You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.' He set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. And this thing became a sin, for the people went to worship before the one at Bethel and before the other as far as Dan."

**NRSV:**  
"You have done evil, surpassing all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods, and cast images, provoking me to anger, and have thrust me behind your back; therefore I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam."

## 1 Kings 16:30-33  
**LSV:**  
"And Ahab son of Omri does evil in the eyes of YHWH above all who were before him, and it comes to pass—was it a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat?—that he takes Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians for a wife, and goes and serves Ba‘al, and bows himself to it, and raises an altar to Ba‘al in the house of Ba‘al that he built in Samaria; and Ahab makes the Asherah, and Ahab adds to do, to provoke YHWH, God of Israel, more than all the kings of Israel who were before him."

**NRSV:**  
"Ahab son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all who were before him. And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, he took as his wife Jezebel daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him. He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria. Ahab also made a sacred pole. Ahab did more to provoke the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, than had all the kings of Israel who were before him."

## 1 Kings 18:21  
**LSV:**  
"And Elijah comes near to all the people and says, 'Until when are you leaping on two branches? If YHWH [is] God—go after Him; and if Ba‘al—go after him.' And the people have not answered him a word."

**NRSV:**  
"Elijah then came near to all the people and said, 'How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.' The people did not answer him a word."

## 1 Kings 21:25-26  
**LSV:**  
"Surely there has been none like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of YHWH, whom his wife Jezebel has moved, and he does abominably to go after the idols—according to all that the Amorite has done, whom YHWH dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel."

**NRSV:**  
"(Indeed, there was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD, urged on by his wife Jezebel. He acted most abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD drove out before the Israelites.)"

## Notes  
- **Solomon’s idolatry (1 Kings 11):** Illustrates how foreign influences led even a wise king into idol worship.
- **Golden calves (1 Kings 12):** Jeroboam’s sin of institutionalizing idol worship marked a major spiritual decline.
- **Ahab and Jezebel (1 Kings 16, 21):** Their partnership amplified idolatry, especially with Baal worship.
- **Elijah’s challenge (1 Kings 18):** Calls for a clear decision between YHWH and false gods.
- **Molten images and high places:** Frequent symbols of Israel’s apostasy throughout the narrative.
