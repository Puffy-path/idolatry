## Malachi 1:6-8  
**LSV:**  
"A son honors [his] father, and a servant his master. || And if I [am] a father, where [is] My honor? || And if I [am] a master, where [is] My fear? || Said YHWH of Hosts to you, O priests, despising My Name! || And you have said, 'In what have we despised Your Name?' You are bringing defiled bread on My altar, || And you have said, 'In what have we defiled You?' || In your saying, 'The table of YHWH—it [is] despicable.' And when you bring the blind for sacrifice, [is it] not evil? And when you bring the lame and sick, [is it] not evil? Now bring it near to your governor—does he accept you? Or does he lift up your face? Said YHWH of Hosts."

**NRSV:**  
"A son honors his father, and servants their master. If then I am a father, where is the honor due me? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. You say, 'How have we despised your name?' By offering polluted food on my altar. And you say, 'How have we polluted it?' By thinking that the LORD’s table may be despised. When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not wrong? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not wrong? Try presenting that to your governor; will he be pleased with you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts."

## Malachi 2:11-12  
**LSV:**  
"Judah has dealt treacherously, || And abomination has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem, || For Judah has profaned the holy thing of YHWH that He has loved, || And has married the daughter of a strange god. YHWH cuts off the man who does it, || Teacher and scholar from the tents of Jacob, || And he who brings a present near to YHWH of Hosts."

**NRSV:**  
"Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob anyone who does this—any to witness or answer—or to bring an offering to the LORD of hosts."

## Malachi 3:5  
**LSV:**  
"And I have drawn near to you for judgment, || And I have been a swift witness against sorcerers, || And against adulterers, || And against those swearing to a lie, || And against oppressors of the hireling's wage, || Of widow and fatherless, || And those turning aside a sojourner, || And who do not fear Me, said YHWH of Hosts."

**NRSV:**  
"Then I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be swift to bear witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired workers in their wages, the widow and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the alien, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts."

## Malachi 3:13-15  
**LSV:**  
"Your words have been hard against Me, said YHWH, || And you have said, 'What have we spoken against You?' You have said, 'It [is] a vain thing to serve God, || And what profit when we kept His charge, || And when we have walked in black [clothing] || Because of YHWH of Hosts? And now we are declaring the proud blessed, || Indeed, those working wickedness have been built up, || Indeed, they have tempted God, and escape.'"

**NRSV:**  
"You have spoken harsh words against me, says the LORD. Yet you say, 'How have we spoken against you?' You have said, 'It is vain to serve God. What do we profit by keeping his command or by going about as mourners before the LORD of hosts? Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper but when they put God to the test they escape.'"

## Notes  
- **Corrupt worship as spiritual idolatry (Malachi 1:6-8):** Offering blemished sacrifices reveals a heart that dishonors God, akin to idol worship through neglect.
- **Syncretism and foreign alliances condemned (Malachi 2:11-12):** Marrying those associated with foreign gods is portrayed as spiritual unfaithfulness.
- **Sorcery and false practices rejected (Malachi 3:5):** God explicitly condemns sorcery and those who defy His commands.
- **Pride and complacency (Malachi 3:13-15):** Questioning God’s justice and exalting the proud reflects a heart turned away from God’s ways.
- **Call to sincere worship:** The book urges the people to honor God through genuine devotion, not empty rituals or compromises.
- **Warning against spiritual apathy:** Indifference to God’s commands is treated as seriously as overt idolatry.
