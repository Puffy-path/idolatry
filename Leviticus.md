And if the people of the land really hide their eyes from that man, in his giving of his seed to Molech, not putting him to death—then I have set My face against that man and against his family, and have cut him off, and all who are going whoring after him, to go whoring after Molech, from the midst of their people. And the person who turns to those having familiar spirits, and to the wizards, to go whoring after them—I have even set My face against that person, and have cut him off from the midst of his people."

And if the people of the land should ever close their eyes to them giving their offspring to Molech, and do not put them to death, I myself will set my face against them and their family and will cut them off from among their people, all who follow them in prostituting themselves to Molech. If any turn to mediums and wizards, prostituting themselves to them, I will set my face against them and will cut them off from among their people."
