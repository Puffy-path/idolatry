## Ruth 1:15-16  
**LSV:**  
"And she says, 'Behold, your sister-in-law has turned back to her people, and to her gods; turn back after your sister-in-law.' And Ruth says, 'Do not urge me to leave you, to turn back from after you; for to where you go, I go, and where you lodge, I lodge; your people [are] my people, and your God my God.'"

**NRSV:**  
"So she said, 'See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.' But Ruth said, 'Do not press me to leave you or to turn back from following you! Where you go, I will go; where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God.'"

## Notes  
- **Reference to foreign gods (Ruth 1:15):** Naomi acknowledges that her daughter-in-law Orpah has returned to the gods of Moab, highlighting the presence of idolatry among surrounding nations.
- **Ruth’s declaration (Ruth 1:16):** Ruth’s renouncement of Moabite gods and her allegiance to the God of Israel marks a significant spiritual conversion and rejection of idolatry.

> ℹ️ *The Book of Ruth focuses primarily on loyalty, redemption, and providence rather than idolatry. The reference to foreign gods occurs only in the context of Ruth’s decision to follow the God of Israel.*
