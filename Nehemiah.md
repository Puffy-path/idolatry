## Nehemiah 9:26-28  
**LSV:**  
"And they rebel, and provoke You to anger, and cast Your Law behind their back, and slay Your prophets who testified against them to bring them back to You, and they do great provocations, and You give them into the hand of their adversaries, and they oppress them; and in the time of their distress they cry to You, and You hear from the heavens, and according to Your abundant mercies, You give saviors to them, and they save them out of the hand of their adversaries. And when they have rest, they turn back to do evil before You, and You leave them in the hand of their enemies, and they rule over them; and they turn back and cry to You, and You hear from the heavens, and deliver them many times according to Your mercies."

**NRSV:**  
"Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their backs and killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies. Therefore you gave them into the hands of their enemies, who made them suffer. Then in the time of their suffering they cried out to you, and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors who saved them from the hands of their enemies. But after they had rest, they again did evil before you, and you abandoned them to the hands of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you rescued them according to your mercies."

## Nehemiah 13:23-27  
**LSV:**  
"Also, I have seen in those days Jews who have given dwelling to women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab; and of their sons, half are speaking Ashdod’s language, and are not knowing to speak Jewish, and according to the language of people and people. And I strive with them, and declare a curse on them, and strike certain of them, and pluck off their hair, and cause them to swear by God, 'You do not give your daughters to their sons, nor do you take of their daughters to your sons, or to yourselves. Has Solomon king of Israel sinned by these things? And among many nations there has been no king like him, and he has been loved of his God, and God makes him king over all Israel—even him—the strange women have caused to sin. And do we hear of you doing all this great evil, to trespass against our God, to settle strange women?'"

**NRSV:**  
"In those days also I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab; and half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke the language of various peoples. And I contended with them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair; and I made them take an oath in the name of God, saying, 'You shall not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. Did not King Solomon of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless, foreign women made even him to sin. Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?'"
