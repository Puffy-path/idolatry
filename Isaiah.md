## Isaiah 2:8-9  
**LSV:**  
"And its land is full of idols, || They bow themselves to the work of their hands, || To that which their fingers made, || And the low bows down, and the high is humbled, || And You do not accept them."

**NRSV:**  
"Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made. And so people are humbled, and everyone is brought low—do not forgive them!"

## Isaiah 10:10-11  
**LSV:**  
"As my hand has gotten to the kingdoms of a worthless thing, || And their carved images [were] more than Jerusalem and Samaria, || Do I not—as I have done to Samaria and to her idols—Do so to Jerusalem and to her worthless things?"

**NRSV:**  
"As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols whose images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria, shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols what I have done to Samaria and her images?"

## Isaiah 30:22  
**LSV:**  
"And you have defiled the covering of your carved images of silver, || And the ephod of your molten image of gold, || You scatter them away as a menstruous cloth, || You say to it, 'Go out!'"

**NRSV:**  
"Then you will defile your silver-covered idols and your gold-plated images. You will scatter them like filthy rags; you will say to them, 'Away with you!'"

## Isaiah 40:19-20  
**LSV:**  
"The artisan has poured out a carved image, || And the refiner spreads it over with gold, || And he is casting chains of silver. He who is poor [by] heave-offering, || Chooses a tree [that] does not rot, || He seeks for himself a skillful artisan, || To establish a carved image—not moved."

**NRSV:**  
"An idol? A workman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts for it silver chains. As a gift one chooses mulberry wood that will not rot, then seeks out a skilled artisan to set up an image that will not topple."

## Isaiah 41:29  
**LSV:**  
"Behold, all of them [are] vanity, || Their works [are] wind and emptiness, || Their molten images [are] emptiness and confusion."

**NRSV:**  
"No, they are all a delusion; their works are nothing; their images are empty wind."

## Isaiah 42:17  
**LSV:**  
"They have turned backward, || They are utterly ashamed, || Those trusting in a carved image, || Who are saying to a molten image, || 'You [are] our gods.'"

**NRSV:**  
"They shall be turned back and utterly put to shame—those who trust in carved images, who say to cast images, 'You are our gods.'"

## Isaiah 44:9-11  
**LSV:**  
"Framers of a carved image [are] all of them emptiness, || And their desirable things do not profit, || And their own witnesses do not see, nor know, || That they may be ashamed. Who has formed a god, || And poured out a molten image—not profitable? Behold, all his companions are ashamed, || And the craftsmen—they [are] of men, || They all assemble, they stand up, || They fear, they are ashamed together."

**NRSV:**  
"All who make idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit; their witnesses neither see nor know. And so they will be put to shame. Who would fashion a god or cast an image that can do no good? Look, all its devotees shall be put to shame; the artisans too are only human. Let them all assemble, let them stand up; they shall be terrified, they shall all be put to shame."

## Isaiah 46:6-7  
**LSV:**  
"They are pouring out gold from a bag, || And weighing silver on a beam, || They hire a refiner, and he makes it a god, || They fall down, indeed, they bow themselves. They carry it on the shoulder, they bear it, || And cause it to rest in its place, and it stands, || It does not move from its place, || Indeed, [one] cries to it, but it does not answer, || It does not save him from his distress."

**NRSV:**  
"Those who lavish gold from the purse and weigh out silver in the scales— they hire a goldsmith, who makes it into a god; then they fall down and worship! They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it, they set it in its place, and it stands there; it cannot move from its place. If one cries out to it, it does not answer or save anyone from trouble."

---

## Isaiah 57:13  
**LSV:**  
"When you cry, let your gatherings deliver you, || And wind carries all of them away, || Vanity takes them up, || And whoever is trusting in Me inherits the land, || And possesses My holy mountain."

**NRSV:**  
"When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! The wind will carry them off, a breath will take them away. But whoever takes refuge in me shall possess the land and inherit my holy mountain."

## Notes  
- **Futility of idols (Isaiah 2:8-9; 41:29; 42:17; 44:9-11; 46:6-7):** Repeatedly emphasizes that idols are man-made, powerless, and lead to shame.
- **Contrast between YHWH and idols (Isaiah 40:19-20; 46:6-7):** God is the Creator, while idols are lifeless creations of human hands.
- **Judgment on idol worship (Isaiah 10:10-11; 57:13):** Idolatry leads to destruction and divine rejection.
- **Call to repentance (Isaiah 30:22; 42:17):** Urges the people to discard idols and return to trusting in God alone.
- **Vanity and emptiness of false gods:** Idols are described as emptiness, delusion, and vanity, unable to respond or save.
