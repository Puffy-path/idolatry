## Ecclesiastes 5:1-2  
**LSV:**  
"Keep your foot when you go to the house of God, || And to draw near to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, || For they do not know that they do evil. Do not be hasty with your mouth, || And do not let your heart hurry to bring forth a word before God, || For God is in the heavens, and you [are] on earth, || Therefore let your words be few."

**NRSV:**  
"Guard your steps when you go to the house of God; to draw near to listen is better than the sacrifice offered by fools, for they do not know how to keep from doing evil. Never be rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be quick to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven, and you upon earth; therefore let your words be few."

## Ecclesiastes 5:10  
**LSV:**  
"Whoever is loving silver is not satisfied with silver, || Nor he who is in love with stores with increase. This also [is] vanity."

**NRSV:**  
"The lover of money will not be satisfied with money; nor the lover of wealth, with gain. This also is vanity."

## Ecclesiastes 7:16-18  
**LSV:**  
"Do not be over-righteous, nor show yourself too wise, || Why are you desolate? Do not be over-wicked, nor be a fool, || Why do you die within your time? [It is] good that you lay hold on this, and also from that do not withdraw your hand, || For he who is fearing God goes out with all of them."

**NRSV:**  
"Do not be too righteous, and do not act too wise; why should you destroy yourself? Do not be too wicked, and do not be a fool; why should you die before your time? It is good that you should take hold of the one, without letting go of the other; for the one who fears God shall succeed with both."

## Ecclesiastes 12:13-14  
**LSV:**  
"The end of the whole matter let us hear: Fear God, and keep His commands, for this [is] the whole [duty] of man. For God brings every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether good or evil."

**NRSV:**  
"The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil."

## Notes  
- **Vain pursuits as modern idolatry (Ecclesiastes 5:10; 7:16-18):** Excessive pursuit of wealth or wisdom without God is portrayed as meaningless and akin to idolatry.
- **True worship over empty ritual (Ecclesiastes 5:1-2):** Highlights the importance of reverence and listening over mindless sacrifice.
- **Fear of God as the antidote to idolatry (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14):** Emphasizes that reverence for God and obedience to His commands should be the central focus of life.
- **Balance and humility (Ecclesiastes 7:16-18):** Warns against self-righteousness and pride, which can become forms of self-idolatry.
- **Hidden deeds under judgment:** Idolatry isn’t just outward actions but also internal attitudes and secret motives.
