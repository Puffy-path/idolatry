## Zephaniah 1:3-5  
**LSV:**  
"I consume man and beast, || I consume the bird of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, || And the stumbling-blocks—the wicked, || And I have cut off man from the face of the ground, || A declaration of YHWH, || And stretched out My hand against Judah, || And against all inhabitants of Jerusalem, || And cut off the remnant of Ba‘al from this place, || The name of the idolatrous priests, with the priests, || And those bowing themselves on the housetops to the host of the heavens, || And those bowing themselves, || Swearing to YHWH, and swearing by Malcam."

**NRSV:**  
"I will sweep away humans and animals; I will sweep away the birds of the air and the fish of the sea. I will make the wicked stumble. I will cut off humanity from the face of the earth, says the LORD. I will stretch out my hand against Judah, and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal and the name of the idolatrous priests; those who bow down on the roofs to the host of the heavens; those who bow down and swear to the LORD but also swear by Milcom."

"On that day I will punish all who leap over the threshold, who fill their master’s house with violence and fraud."

## Zephaniah 1:12  
**LSV:**  
"And it has come to pass, || At that time I search Jerusalem with lamps, || And I have laid a charge against the men who are settled on their dregs, || Who are saying in their heart: YHWH does no good, nor does He evil."

"At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the people who rest complacently on their dregs, those who say in their hearts, 'The LORD will not do good, nor will he do harm.'"

## Zephaniah 1:17-18  
**LSV:**  
"And I have distressed men, || And they have walked as the blind, || For they have sinned against YHWH, || And their blood has been poured out as dust, || And their flesh [is] as dung. Their silver and their gold are not able to deliver them || In the day of the wrath of YHWH, || And by the fire of His jealousy is all the land consumed, || For He makes a tender end, || Indeed, a hurried end of all the inhabitants of the land."

**NRSV:**  
"I will bring such distress upon people that they shall walk like the blind; because they have sinned against the LORD, their blood shall be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung. Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD’s wrath; in the fire of his passion the whole earth shall be consumed; for a full, a terrible end he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth."

## Zephaniah 2:11  
**LSV:**

**NRSV:**  
"The LORD will be terrible against them; he will shrivel all the gods of the earth, and to him shall bow down, each in its place, all the coasts and islands of the nations."

## Notes  
- **Eradication of idol worship (Zephaniah 1:4-5; 2:11):** God promises to cut off Baal worship, star worship, and the syncretism of swearing to both YHWH and foreign gods.
- **Judgment against complacency (Zephaniah 1:12):** Complacency and spiritual indifference are condemned as forms of practical idolatry.
- **False security in wealth (Zephaniah 1:17-18):** Trusting in silver and gold instead of God is shown to be futile.
- **Universal recognition of YHWH (Zephaniah 2:11):** False gods are rendered powerless, with all nations ultimately bowing to the true God.
- **Divine justice against corruption (Zephaniah 1:9):** Idolatry is connected to moral corruption, violence, and deceit.
- **The Day of the LORD:** A central theme emphasizing the urgency of repentance from idolatry and returning to God.
