## 1 Chronicles 5:25-26  
**LSV:**  
"And they trespass against the God of their fathers, and go whoring after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God destroyed from their presence; and the God of Israel stirs up the spirit of Pul king of Asshur, and the spirit of Tilgath-Pilneser king of Asshur, and he removes them—the Reubenite, and the Gadite, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh—and brings them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and the river Gozan, to this day."

**NRSV:**  
"But they transgressed against the God of their ancestors and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them. So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of King Pul of Assyria, the spirit of King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria, and he carried them away—the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh—and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river Gozan, to this day."

**NRSV:**  
"So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the LORD in that he did not keep the word of the LORD; moreover, he had consulted a medium, seeking guidance, and did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse."

**NRSV:**  
"And you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve him with single mind and willing heart; for the LORD searches every mind and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will abandon you forever."
