## Job 1:5  
**LSV:**  
"And it comes to pass, when the days of the banquet have gone around, that Job sends and sanctifies them, and has risen early in the morning, and causes burnt-offerings to ascend—the number of them all; for Job said, 'Perhaps my sons have sinned and blessed God in their heart.' Thus Job does [this] all the days."

**NRSV:**  
"When the feast days had run their course, Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, 'It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.' This is what Job always did."

## Job 8:13-15  
**LSV:**  
"So [are] the paths of all forgetting God, || And the hope of the profane perishes, || Whose confidence is cut off, || And his trust [is] a spider’s web. || He leans on his house—and it does not stand, || He takes hold on it—and it does not endure."

**NRSV:**  
"Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish. Their confidence is gossamer, a spider’s house their trust. If one leans against its house, it will not stand; if one lays hold of it, it will not endure."

## Job 22:23-25  
**LSV:**  
"If you return to the Mighty—you are built up, || You put iniquity far from your tents. || And you have placed a defense on the dust, || And a defense on a rock of the valleys. || And the Mighty has been your defense, || And silver [is] strength to you."

**NRSV:**  
"If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored, if you remove unrighteousness from your tents, if you treat gold like dust, and gold of Ophir like the stones of the torrent-bed, and if the Almighty is your gold and your precious silver."

## Job 31:24-28  
**LSV:**  
"If I have made gold my confidence, || And to the fine gold have said, ‘My trust,’ || If I rejoice because my wealth [is] great, || And because my hand has found abundance, || If I see the light when it shines, || And the precious moon walking, || And my heart is enticed in secret, || And my hand kisses my mouth, || It also [is] a judicial iniquity, || For I had lied to God above."

**NRSV:**  
"If I have made gold my trust, or called fine gold my confidence; if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, or because my hand had gotten much; if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor, and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand; this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I should have been false to God above."

## Notes  
- **False security in wealth (Job 22:23-25; 31:24-28):** Equates trust in riches with idolatry, highlighting that ultimate reliance must be on God.
- **Rejection of celestial worship (Job 31:26-28):** Condemns worship of the sun and moon, common forms of ancient idolatry.
- **Hope in God vs. worldly things (Job 8:13-15):** Contrasts lasting security in God with the fragile nature of idolatrous trust.
- **Personal responsibility (Job 1:5):** Job’s regular sacrifices show vigilance against hidden or unintentional sin, including spiritual waywardness.
- **Idolatry of the heart:** Emphasizes that idolatry isn’t just external acts but also internal attitudes like covetousness and misplaced trust.
