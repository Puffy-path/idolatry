## Habakkuk 2:18-20  
**LSV:**  
"What does the carved image profit? || For its former has carved it, || A molten image, and a teacher of falsehood, || For the former has trusted in his own work, || To make mute idols. Woe to him who is saying to the wood, ‘Awake,’ || To a silent stone, ‘Rise,’ || Does it teach? Behold, it is covered with gold and silver, || And there is no breath in its midst. But YHWH [is] in His holy temple, || Be silent before Him, all the earth!"

**NRSV:**  
"What use is an idol once its maker has shaped it—a cast image, a teacher of lies? For its maker trusts in what has been made, though the product is only an idol that cannot speak! Alas for you who say to the wood, ‘Wake up!’ to silent stone, ‘Rouse yourself!’ Can it teach? See, it is gold and silver plated, and there is no breath in it at all. But the LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him!"

## Notes  
- **Futility of idols (Habakkuk 2:18):** Carved images are described as worthless and deceptive, providing no real guidance.
- **Critique of idol worship (Habakkuk 2:19):** People who speak to lifeless objects are rebuked for placing trust in man-made creations.
- **Contrast with the living God (Habakkuk 2:20):** Unlike idols, YHWH is alive and reigning in His temple, deserving reverence and silence from all creation.
- **Idolatry as self-deception:** Trusting in one’s handiwork over the Creator is seen as foolish and vain.
- **Call to global acknowledgment of God:** The closing call for silence before God highlights His supreme authority over all false gods.
