## Jonah 1:5-6  
**LSV:**  
"And the mariners are afraid, and each cries to his god, || And they cast out the goods that [are] in the ship into the sea, to make [it] light of them, || And Jonah has gone down into the sides of the ship, || And he lies down, and is fast asleep. And the chief of the seamen draws near to him and says to him, 'What [is] [wrong] with you, O sleeper? Rise, call to your God, it may be God gives thought for us, and we do not perish.'"

**NRSV:**  
"Then the sailors were afraid, and each cried to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. Jonah, meanwhile, had gone down into the hold of the ship and had lain down, and was fast asleep. The captain came and said to him, 'What are you doing sound asleep? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps the god will spare us a thought so that we do not perish.'"

## Jonah 1:14-16  
**LSV:**  
"And they cry to YHWH and say, 'Ah, now, O YHWH, please do not let us perish for this man’s life, and do not appoint on us innocent blood, for You, O YHWH, have done as You have pleased.' And they lift up Jonah and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceases from its raging; and the men fear YHWH greatly, and they sacrifice a sacrifice to YHWH, and vow vows."

**NRSV:**  
"Then they cried out to the LORD, 'Please, O LORD, we pray, do not let us perish on account of this man’s life. Do not make us guilty of innocent blood; for you, O LORD, have done as it pleased you.' So they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. Then the men feared the LORD even more, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows."

## Jonah 2:8-9  
**LSV:**  
"Those observing lying vanities forsake their own mercy. And I—with a voice of thanksgiving—I sacrifice to You; What I have vowed, I complete; Salvation [is] of YHWH."

**NRSV:**  
"Those who worship vain idols forsake their true loyalty. But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Deliverance belongs to the LORD!"

## Jonah 3:5-8  
**LSV:**  
"And the men of Nineveh believe in God, and they proclaim a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest even to the least of them; seeing the word reaches the king of Nineveh, and he rises from his throne, and causes his honor to pass away from him, and covers himself with sackcloth, and sits on the ashes, and cries and says in Nineveh by decree of the king and his great ones, saying: ‘Man and beast, herd and flock—do not taste anything, do not feed, nor drink water; and cover man and beast with sackcloth, and cry to God mightily, and let each turn back from his evil way, and from the violence that [is] in their hands.’"

**NRSV:**  
"And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth. When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. Then he had a proclamation made in Nineveh: 'By the decree of the king and his nobles: No human being or animal, no herd or flock, shall taste anything. They shall not feed, nor shall they drink water. Human beings and animals shall be covered with sackcloth, and they shall cry mightily to God. All shall turn from their evil ways and from the violence that is in their hands.'"

## Notes  
- **Pagan idolatry contrasted with true worship (Jonah 1:5-6, 1:14-16):** The sailors initially pray to their own gods but turn to YHWH when recognizing His power.
- **Rejection of false gods (Jonah 2:8-9):** Jonah acknowledges that worshiping "vain idols" leads people away from God’s mercy.
- **Repentance in Nineveh (Jonah 3:5-8):** A pagan city turns from its evil ways and seeks the true God, abandoning former idolatrous practices.
- **Universal recognition of YHWH:** Even non-Israelites come to fear and worship God, highlighting His sovereignty over all nations.
- **Idolatry as "lying vanities":** Jonah’s term emphasizes the emptiness and deception of trusting in anything other than God.
